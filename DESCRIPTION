Description: This is an unofficial UQ template for making slideshows
    in RMarkdown. It makes use of the Xaringan package by Yihui Xie 
    which, in turn, is built on Remark.js. This template has been built 
    for my own personal use. I welcome anyone to use it if they find it 
    useful, but I make absolutely no guarantees with regards to maintenance
    or help. I stress that this is an **unofficial** UQ template which is 
    in no way sanctioned or endorsed by The University of Queensland. It is
    based on the new UQ Brand .pptx slideshow template available at 
    https://omc.uq.edu.au/uq-brand and although I have made every effort to 
    do so, I make no guarantees that it conforms to the UQ brand guidelines
    exactly. You should therefore make your own judgement whether the 
    template is adequate for your needs. The UQ Office of Marketing and 
    Communications should be consulted for guidelines around appropriate 
    use of the UQ Brand.
